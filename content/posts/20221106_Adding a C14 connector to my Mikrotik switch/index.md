Recently, I bought some used mikrotik CRS326-24G-2S+RM

{{<og "https://mikrotik.com/product/CRS326-24G-2SplusRM">}}

These switches are remarkable 1g switches for the price, but they have one flaw that some sysadmins consider a pretty big one: they use an external power adapter

## Feasibility
Mikrotik also has the same version which is a bit smaller and not rack mounted (the [CRS326-24G-2S+IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs326_24g_2s_in)) which makes me think the motherboard in the rack mounted version is the same :sweat_smile:

The back of the switch has an IEC C14 cutout in the metal, it's like one of their engineer knew someone was going to do this :rofl:

The power adapter itself is a 24v 1.2amp one

And the input on the switch specify a range of 10v to 28v, so it should be pretty easy to find a replacement power supply

Adding the IEC C14 connector was a no-brainer really, I only needed the connector and power supply.

## Parts
After a quick Amazon search, I choose this adapter, mainly because it matched the original one pretty well and was the fastest delivery one: https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B08P8S4SY6

I also bought these connectors: https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07YTZYSTT

## Wiring everything
I got some wires from an old 220v cable, soldered them to the C14 connector added some heat shrink and screwed the other side to the power supply input

As I predicted, 1/3 of the case is empty, leaving more than enough space for the power supply

So, I went on and broke the little tabs, screwed in the C14 connector and connected the power supply:

To actually power the switch, I hesitated between soldering straight to the board and making a wire+connector come out of the case. As the switch is already out of warranty, so I decided to solder directly to the board.

Fortunately, the PCB has some holes that I can use properly instead of soldering to the connector tabs:

I also added the earth from the IEC C14 to a screw that touched the chassis:

After a quick test to confirm, it still lighted up :fire: :

I added a little piece of tape between the original connector and the case so that I wouldn't accidentally power it from here:

## Finishing up

And finally, I closed everything and put it back to work on my desk:

## Conclusion

All in all, this is an effortless mod that solves a relatively big issue, and I'll repeat it to the other two switches I own :smile:
