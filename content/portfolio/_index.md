Hey, I'm Samuel, I'm a {{< age >}} years old maker. I really like computers / electronics & hardware design / radio communication / space / 3D Design and audiovisual stuff.
I currently live in Alsace, France and while I like French, I prefer using English when I can. If you are eager to learn more, just scroll a bit.
If you wish to see my recent work / current projects, you might want to go to my blog.

### {{< mdi "mdi-wrench" >}} Technologies

I've spent some time creating a page that contains a non-exhaustive list of the various technologies & hardware I worked with at some point in my personal, professional or associative projects and activities.

## Interests
### {{< mdi "mdi-satellite-variant" >}} Space & Radio communications
I'm a big space nerd, especially space radio communications and rf signals in general; I've received multiple images from meteorological satellites such as the NOAA and METEOR satellites series and planning to receive more advanced ones. I've previously received an ARISS<sup>[Link](https://www.ariss.org/)</sup> SSTV Award. [See the award](images/sstv-diploma.png). I'm currently on my way studying to get my Amateur Radio License to be able to transmit and bounce my way around satellites like [QO-100](https://amsat-uk.org/satellites/geo/eshail-2/EsHail-2).

### {{< mdi "mdi-cpu-64-bit" >}} Hardware
Aside from software development, I also enjoy doing firmware development and hardware design. I'm completely self-taught in this domain, and I'm learning project after project of the mistakes I make.
I've worked on all kinds of stuff including [hardware authentication tokens](https://blog.thestaticturtle.fr/lets-make-a-diy-gpg-usb-key/), [USB to RF converter](https://blog.thestaticturtle.fr/open433-lets-turn-light-on-with-the-computer/), [energy meter adapter](https://blog.thestaticturtle.fr/linkylink-connecting-myself-to-the-energy-meter/), etc ….
Doing these projects helps me gain a good understanding of the good practices in schematic drawing and PCB design.

### {{< mdi "mdi-printer-3d" >}} 3D-Modeling
From high school to right now, I've learned plenty of things in CAD and 3D printing. Since I own a 3D printer, I had to learn a lot of this stuff on my own. I design almost everything myself, like basic enclosures, to the hardest design that I ever made: [bone conduction glasses!](https://blog.thestaticturtle.fr/bone-conduction-glasses/)

### {{< mdi "mdi-server" >}} Self-hosting & Automation
One of the things I do the most is managing and experimenting on my own network infrastructure at home. I run a complete network including a domain, SSO,  multiple hypervisors, isolated vlans, storage, monitoring, etc….

I run services like HomeAssistant, Node-Red, Paperless which help me to organize and automate my daily life

### {{< mdi "mdi-cast-audio" >}} Audio / Video
I also like participating in the audio, and lighting crew  at the backstage of concerts / events. I have basic notions of audio mixing and simple light shows. Furthermore, I'm also starting to learn the big world of video production.

I annually attend the ["Fête de la Sorcière" (Witch's Day)](https://www.fete-sorciere.com/) at Rouffach in France, and when it's scheduled, I help in the backstage at a [choir](https://choraleoberhergheim.wixsite.com/choraleoberhergheim).
